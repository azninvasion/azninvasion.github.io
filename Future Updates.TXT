Plan for the Website
--------------------
Ellan - Might Have to make another repository for the signup page. Just so i can store up more database
for users and prevent other people from hacking into their accounts. Unless they find the new repository 
website of course lol. - As of right now Im learning python for the time being. For year 11 DTC and so on,
so i cant guarantee this will be up and running.
================================================
But I will be trying to learn PHP or SQl or see which is a better database language in my own free time.
